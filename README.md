## Development

### Setup

- Install [`docker`](https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
- Install `make`

That's all folks!
All other tools are packaged in build Docker images (see `Dockerfile`) to ensure any machine can build easily, hence avoiding the "[_it works on my machine_](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/03/the-works-on-my-machine-certification-program.html)" syndrome.

### Build

```console
make
```
